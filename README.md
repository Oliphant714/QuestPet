QuestPet (Update)

QuestPet is a prototype desktop companion designed to blend productivity tracking, gamification, and personality-driven interaction. At its core, QuestPet is a growing digital creature (currently a dragon named Ember) that reacts to user behavior such as completing tasks, idling, and investing in self-improvement.

Unlike a traditional AI assistant, QuestPet is intentionally built as a state-driven desktop pet: it observes patterns, forms a personality over time, and responds emotionally and contextually without relying on large language models. The long-term goal is to create a digital companion that feels alive, supportive, and occasionally challenging—without ever being harsh or mean.

Instructions for Build and Use
Steps to build and/or run the software:

Ensure Python 3.10 or later is installed on your system.

Clone or download the QuestPet project files.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the main Python file:

python questpet.py

Instructions for using the software:

Launch the application to open the QuestPet window.

View active quests in the Active Quests list.

Select a task and click Complete Task to earn XP for your dragon.

When growth points are available, use the stat buttons to shape the dragon’s personality.

Observe how the dragon reacts to your behavior over time through messages and callouts.

Leave the app idle to see idle reactions and personality-driven commentary.

Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

 Implement an Instinct System (Play / Assist / Observe)

 Add emotional decay and cooldowns for callout behavior

 Improve UserState modeling (stress, focus, motivation)

 Introduce multiple creature types (dragon, golem, puppicorn)

 Add on-screen movement and desktop interaction

 Integrate screen-reading for automatic task detection

 Optional AI-generated dialogue layer (hybrid system)

 Persist user and creature state between sessions

 Improve UI layout and visual feedback
